# Virt-A-Mate Plugin

This plugin will let you choose a Microphone and will send the audio from that microphone to the AudioSource
on the Atom that you add this to.

It works well with the Lip Sync plugin.

Example:
- Add this script to a Person
- Add the lipsync plugin to a Person
- Open the Microphone plugin UI and choose a Mic
- lipsync will now react to your voice
